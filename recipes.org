- shaken
** Ingredients
- 2 oz. bourbon
- 3/4 oz. honey syrup
- 3/8-1/2 oz. juice from fresh lemon
** Directions
Shake all ingredients well with ice. Strain into old fashioned glass with single large ice cube.
** Notes
- Honey syrup is made by combining 3 parts honey to 1 part water and mixing over medium heat until dissolved.
- The traditional recipe calls for 3/4 oz. lemon juice. I feel that this overpowers the drink.
- It's not recommended to try shaking with egg white, as in a sour. The honey syrup provides enough thickening and smoothing.
